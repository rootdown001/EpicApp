# Add README.md text

Provider will be able to have app collect selected patient's data and run through SECURE (off grid) AI model to look for decline (hospice care)

App was inspired by discussion with hospice provider. He was feeling burnout due to trying to read entire patient file to look for signs of decline. He dreamed of a way to help with this.

This app will allow provider to choose his/her patient, as well as the the endpoints to read. Secure transaction will occur, and patient data will be securely brought to client app. Info is run through secure AI model.

Model will summarize decline. It will also use medical medicare / medicaid standards for palliative care organizational standards.
